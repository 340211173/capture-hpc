+ ability to automatically collect downloaded malware
+ ability to automatically collect network traffic on the client

+ improved control of Internet Explorer: obtain html error codes; specify visitation delay AFTER page has been retrieved; retry visitation of URLs in case of time outs or network errors
+ support for plug-in architecture, that allows to create fine grained control of clients (for example, as provided for Internet Explorer), but also allows for integration of client applications that require complex interactions to retrieve content from the web (e.g. Safari is such an application. It doesn’t allow retrieval of web content by passing the URL as a parameter)
