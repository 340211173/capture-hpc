Version 2.0.1
-----------
Changes
-------
+ fixed bug 699, 666, 673
+ increased some timeouts on the server that trigger upon the client connecting to the server. Should allow to use more client instances with one server.
+ Capture-HPC is now compiled with Visual C++ SP1. As a result, the Visual C++ Redist Libraries SP1 are required to run Capture-HPC. One can still compile Capture-HPC without the service pack. However, we only destribute the version with service pack.
+ compiled vix libs are compatible with vmware server 1.0.4

Version 2.0
-----------
Changes
-------
+ support for any client application that is http protocol aware (for example, Microsoft Excel)
+ ability to automatically collect downloaded malware
+ ability to automatically collect network traffic on the client
+ ability to push exclusion lists from the Capture Server to the Capture Client
+ improved control of Internet Explorer: obtain html error codes; specify visitation delay AFTER page has been retrieved; retry visitation of URLs in case of time outs or network errors
+ support for plug-in architecture, that allows to create fine grained control of clients (for example, as provided for Internet Explorer), but also allows for integration of client applications that require complex interactions to retrieve content from the web (e.g. Safari is such an application. It doesn’t allow retrieval of web content by passing the URL as a parameter)
+ enhancement to file monitor to monitor file deletions
+ communication between Capture Client and Server has been converted to XML. This allows one to easily write custom Capture Servers that utilize the existing Capture Client.
+ added installer/uninstaller for the Capture Client
+ improved reporting
+ improved stability
+ improved performance
+ numerous bug fixes
